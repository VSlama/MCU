                <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across all the different media of the MCU.</p>

                <p>Stan Lee is an American comic-book writer, editor, and publisher, who was formerly executive vice president and publisher of Marvel Comics.</p>
                <p>Lee co-created Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor, the X-Men, and many other fictional characters, introducing a thoroughly shared universe into superhero comic books. In addition, he challenged the comics' industry's censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.</p>
                <p>He has had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects. A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in the creation of certain characters.</p>
                <p>On 16 July 2017, Lee was named a Disney Legend, a hall of fame program that recognizes individuals who have made an extraordinary and integral contribution to The Walt Disney Company.</p>
                <P>Stan Lee has made multiple cameo appearances in Marvel Comics movies, whether it be talking or not talking. The 93-year-old has subtly appeared in all manner of Marvel media. He does films, including Marvel/Disney collaborations like "The Avengers" and "Guardians of the Galaxy" and Marvel/Fox film franchises like "X-Men," as well as Netflix and ABC television adaptations.</P>
                <p>Here in the video you can see every cameo he ever did.</p>
